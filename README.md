# ProjectBeetle

This is C firmware I developed in MPlabX IDE for a PIC18f26k22 microcontroller target.
The device is a mechanical robot featuring two wheels and an array of sensors which trigger when the 'Beetle' runs into an object. Its only purpose in life is to wander around the office floor, guided by its randomness generator!
